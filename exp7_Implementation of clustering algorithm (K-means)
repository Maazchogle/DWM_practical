Aim: Implementation of clustering algorithm (K-means)


Theory:
K means is one of the most popular Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms Used
for Solving Classification Problems in data science and is very important if you are
aiming for a data scientist role. K Means segregates the unlabeled data into various
groups, called clusters, based on having similar features and common patterns. This
tutorial will teach you the definition and applications of clustering, focusing on the K
means clustering algorithm and its implementation in Python. It will also tell you how
to choose the optimum number of clusters for a dataset.

What is k-means Clustering?
K means clustering is the simplest clustering algorithm. In the K-Clustering algorithm,
the dataset is partitioned into K clusters. An objective function is used to find the quality
of partitions so that similar objects are in one cluster and dissimilar objects in other
groups. In this method, the centroid of a cluster is found to represent a cluster. The
centroid is taken as the center of the cluster which is calculated as the mean value of
points within the cluster. Now the quality of clustering is found by measuring the
Euclidean distance between the point and center. This distance should be maximum.

Implementation of the K-Means Algorithm:
Step 1: Select the value of K to decide the number of clusters (n_clusters) to be formed.
Step 2: Select random K points that will act as cluster centroids (cluster_centers).
Step 3: Assign each data point, based on their distance from the randomly selected
points (Centroid), to the nearest/closest centroid, which will form the predefined
clusters.
Step 4: Place a new centroid of each cluster.
Step 5: Repeat step no.3, which reassigns each datapoint to the new closest centroid of
each cluster.
Step 6: If any reassignment occurs, then go to step 4; else, go to step 7.
Step 7: Finish

Program:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# Reading the database
data = pd.read_csv('cluster.csv')
print("\n")
# Printing the data
print(data.head())
plt.title('K-means Algorithm')
plt.scatter(data['Longitude'],data['Latitude'])
plt.xlim(-180,180)
plt.ylim(-90,90)
# Adding the legends
plt.show()

Conclusion:
In conclusion, K-means clustering is a key unsupervised machine learning algorithm
widely used in data science for classification. It divides unlabeled data into clusters
based on similar features and patterns. The goal is to optimize clustering quality,
ensuring similar objects are in one cluster and dissimilar ones in separate clusters.
This is achieved by computing centroids (cluster centers) as mean values of cluster
points and using the Euclidean distance to evaluate clustering quality..
